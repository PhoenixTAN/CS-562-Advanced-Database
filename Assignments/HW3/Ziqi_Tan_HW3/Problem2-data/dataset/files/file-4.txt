Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces PresidentRichard Nixonto initialize the Sentinel program.
Erik (now Magneto) obtains his signature helmet to block out Xaviers psychic powers, and secretly takes control of the constructed Sentinels. Xavier abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind.
